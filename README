Play with linked lists and binary trees easily !

This library provides a basic set of functions for both structures. There's
only one rule to use the library, you have to declare your structures like
this:

* Linked lists

  struct list {
    struct list *next;
    ...
  };

* Binary trees

  struct tree {
    struct tree *left;
    struct tree *right;
    ...
  };

Take a look to `list.h' and `tree.h' in `scr' directory for details.
